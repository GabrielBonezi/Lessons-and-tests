let myAge = 27; // My actual age

My name is gabriel. I am 27 years old in human years wich is 121 years old in dog years.

changing myAge to 1 will result in:

-4
21
17
My name is Gabriel. I am 1 years old in human years wich is 17 years old in dog years.

However that solution is wrong, if my age is equal to 1, I'd be 10,5 years old in dog's years.

I'll try and fix that bellow:
--
let myAge = 27; // My actual age
myAge = 1
let earlyYears = 2;
let laterYears = myAge - 2; // the first two years are already accounted in the earlyYears variable
let dogLaterYears = laterYears * 4
let dogEarlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;
const myName = 'Gabriel'


console.log(dogLaterYears);
console.log(dogEarlyYears);

if (myAge == 2) {
let myAgeInDogYears = dogLaterYears + dogEarlyYears;
console.log(myAgeInDogYears);
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years wich is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
} else {
  myAgeInDogYears = myAge * 10.5;
  console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years wich is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`) };
--

Now, with the age being 1 year old, the output will be:

My name is Gabriel. I am 1 years old in human years wich is 10.5 years old in dog years.

being 1.5 years old, the result will be:

My name is Gabriel. I am 1.5 years old in human years wich is 15.75 years old in dog years.
