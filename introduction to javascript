function console.log(xxx)

The function allows the user to display an information. If I want the code to say "hello", I simply write

console.log(hello);

Then the response will be

hello

Sometimes it's important to leave some notes, not only for yourself in the future, but for other programmers to understand better the roles of that specific line or function.
To do that, you can simply use "//" or "/*" and "*/". For example:

// Bellow the code says the name of the owner
console.log (Gabriel)
/* Above the code says the name of the owner */
